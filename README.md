# ðŸŽ¥ Movie collection - A REST-ful CRUD API ðŸŽ¥

## Introduction:

"This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis."

This is my first solo project creating a REST-ful CRUD API. I worked with movie collection data which I created as dummy using Express, Typeorm, and Postgres.


## Installation:

1. To get started, clone the repo to a local directory.
```
git clone repo link 
```
2. Install the packages.
```
yarn add
``` 
3. Set up the local database.
```
CREATE DATABASE movie_manager
``` 
4. Run the migrations and seed files to create tables and populate the database.
```
yarn migrate && yarn seed
```
5. Start the database server. The default port is set to localhost:5000.
```
yarn start
```
6. Add your movie collections!ðŸŽ¥
